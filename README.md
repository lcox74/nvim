# Neovim Config

This is my configuration for Neovim. I've been gradually adopting Neovim as an integral part of my development workflow. The goal of this repository is to make it easy to install and maintain my Neovim setup across multiple development machines. I will continue to update and refine this configuration as I become more comfortable with Neovim.

```bash
# Install required packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y neovim ripgrep git

# Create Neovim config directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim

# Install the config
git clone https://github.com/lcox74/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
